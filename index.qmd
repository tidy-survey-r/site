::: {#abstract}


Surveys are powerful tools for gathering information, uncovering insights, and facilitating decision-making. However, to ensure the accurate interpretation of results, they require specific analysis methods. In this book, readers embark on an in-depth journey into conducting complex survey analysis with the {srvyr} package and tidyverse family of functions from the R programming language. Intended for intermediate R users familiar with the basics of the tidyverse, this book gives readers a deeper understanding of applying appropriate survey analysis techniques using {srvyr}, {survey}, and other related packages. With practical walkthroughs featuring real-world datasets, such as the American National Election Studies and Residential Energy Consumption Survey, readers will develop the skills necessary to perform impactful survey analysis on survey data collected through a randomized sample design. Additionally, this book teaches readers how to interpret and communicate results of survey data effectively.

Key Features:

- Uses the {srvyr} package and tidyverse family of packages.
- Grants a conceptual understanding of the statistical methods that the functions apply to.
- Includes practical walkthroughs using publicly available survey data.
- Provides the reader with the tools for interpreting, visualizing, and presenting results.
