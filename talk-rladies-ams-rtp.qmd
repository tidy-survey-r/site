# Book overview {background-color='{{< brand color secondary >}}'}

## Motivation
- We are R users who work with survey data regularly
- Share knowledge with
  - R users who are inaccurately analyzing survey data
  - SAS/SUDAAN/Stata users who may not know about the capabilities of R
- {srvyr} package developed using tidyverse style syntax
- Stephanie and Rebecca conducted a virtual short course at AAPOR conference in 2021
- Connected with Isabella to turn the short course into a book

::: {.notes}
- {survey} original survey analysis package -- book by Thomas Lumley
- {srvyr} builds off the {survey} package, but uses easier to understand tidyverse syntax style
:::

## What's in the book
- High level overview of survey process
- Comparison of syntax between {dplyr} and {srvyr}
- How to read survey documentation
- Descriptive analysis, statistical testing, and modeling
- Publication ready tables and figures accounting for error
- Creating the survey design object
- Analysis examples using real world data

::: {.notes}
- Assume that weights are already on the dataset
- Does not include how to create weights
:::

## Why weight?

- Weights are constructed based on the probability of selection into survey and adjusted for coverage population
- Using weights reduces the potential of bias
- Weights are often adjusted by demographics and variables likely correlated with outcomes

## Why weight?

```{r}
#| label: why-weight-example
#| echo: false

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)
library(survey)
library(srvyr)
data(api, package = "survey")

apistrat_des <- apistrat %>%
  as_survey_design(
    strata = stype,
    weights = pw
  )

bind_rows(apistrat %>% 
            group_by(cname) %>% 
            summarize(api=mean(growth)) %>% 
            mutate(type="Unweighted"),
          apistrat_des %>% 
            group_by(cname) %>% 
            summarize(api=survey_mean(growth)) %>% 
            mutate(type="Weighted")) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(cname,"^M") | str_detect(cname,"^N") | str_detect(cname,"^P") | cname=="Los Angeles") %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x=cname,y=api,fill=type),position="dodge") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(y="Change in Academic Performance Index",
       x="County Name") + 
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Estimate Type",
                    values = c("#087e8b", "#ff8484"))

```


::: {.notes}
- Example 1: Survey of inmates (hypothetical). More predominately male facilities than female facilities so female facilities are oversampled. Weights are calculated to reflect the actual proportion for the population
- Example 2: Survey of households about energy consumption and expenditure (RECS). Weighting accounts for age of housing unit, type of housing unit, and state
- Example 3: Sample of US citizens about election (ANES). Weighting accounts for:
Age by gender;
    - Race/ethnicity by educational attainment;
    - Marital status by gender;
    - Race/ethnicity by Census region;
    - Nation of birth;
    - Home tenure by Metropolitan status;
    - Population density;
    - Household income;
    - Early voter status
:::

## Strata? PSU? Clusters? Replicate weights?

- The strata/PSU or replicate weights are used to accurately estimate standard errors and perform statistical tests (correct degrees of freedom)
- The packages we introduce take these as parameters and accurately calculate standard errors, confidence intervals, and p-values accounting for the covariance structure
- Only need to specify once - documentation will help you identify elements and sometimes provides SAS, SUDAAN, or even R syntax to get started


# Setup {background-color='{{< brand color secondary >}}'}

## R packages for survey analysis {.smaller}

- {survey} package first on CRAN in 2003
    - descriptive analysis
    - statistical testing
    - modeling
    - weighting
- {srvyr} package first on CRAN in 2016
    - "wrapper" for {survey} with {tidyverse}-style syntax
    - only descriptive analysis
- {gtsummary} package first on CRAN in 2016
    - creates publication-ready tables from survey data
    - currently cannot handle replicate weights

::: {.notes}
- R packages are a collection of functions
- This is not an exhaustive list of packages that work with survey data
- Several packages for imputation, more complex weighting, and more
- gtsummary won't be discussed today

## Comparison with dplyr

- dplyr: summary functions called within `summarize()`

### dplyr

```{r}
#| label: dplyr-load
#| echo: false
library(dplyr)
library(gt)
```

```{r}
#| label: dplyr-towny-example
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3,6|4,5|"
towny %>%
  group_by(status) %>%
  summarize(
    area_mean = mean(land_area_km2),
    area_median = median(land_area_km2)
  )
```

## Comparison with dplyr

- srvyr: `survey_*()` functions called with `summarize()`

### srvyr

```{r}
#| label: apistrat-set-up
#| echo: false

library(srvyr)
data(api, package = "survey")

apistrat_des <- apistrat %>%
  as_survey_design(
    strata = stype,
    weights = pw
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: srvyr-api-example
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3,6|4,5|"
apistrat_des %>%
  group_by(stype) %>%
  summarize(
    api00_mean = survey_mean(api00),
    api00_med = survey_median(api00)
  )
```

::: {.notes}
- If you already use {tidyverse}/{dplyr}, the syntax {srvyr} will come easily
- Functions commonly used like group_by, filter, and summarize also used in srvyr
- Note that the survey estimates also generate standard deviations - can also add options to get CIs, deffs, and variances
:::

## Steps for descriptive analysis

1. Create a `tbl_svy` object (a survey object) using: `as_survey_design()` or `as_survey_rep()`

2. Subset data (if needed) using `filter()` (to create subpopulations)

3. Specify domains of analysis using `group_by()` 

4. Within `summarize()`, specify variables to calculate, including means, totals, proportions, quantiles, and more

::: {.notes}
- Survey object involves specifying weights, strata and/or clusters (PSUs) OR replicate weights
- Survey object can be used over and over for the same data and different analyses
- This is necessary for getting appropriate weighted estimates and standard errors. More public use files are providing this syntax
- Can also use `cascade()` instead of `summarize()` to get the total row
:::

## Steps for testing

1. Create a `tbl_svy` object (a survey object) using: `as_survey_design()` or `as_survey_rep()`

2. Subset data (if needed) using `filter()` (to create subpopulations)

3. Use `svyttest()` for comparisons of proportions and means, `svygofchisq()` for GOF test, or `svychisq()` for test of independence and test of homogeneity

::: {.notes}
- Only last step changes from descriptive analysis. 
:::


## Steps for modeling

1. Create a `tbl_svy` object (a survey object) using: `as_survey_design()` or `as_survey_rep()`

2. Subset data (if needed) using `filter()` (to create subpopulations)

3. Use `svyglm()` for linear models and logistic models, `svycoxph()` for Cox proportional-hazards, `svykm()` for Kaplan-Meier, `svyloglin()` for log-linear models, `svyolr()` for multinomial

::: {.notes}
- Only last step changes from descriptive analysis. Syntax mirrors glm, coxph, etc functions for non-survey data

# Design object {background-color='{{< brand color secondary >}}'}

::: {.notes}
- After loading packages and data
- First step is to create design object

## Implementation

```{r}
#| label: create-design-object
recs_des <- recs_2020 %>%
  as_survey_rep(
    weights = NWEIGHT, # <1>
    repweights = NWEIGHT1:NWEIGHT60, # <2>
    type = "JK1",
    scale = 59 / 60,
    mse = TRUE
  )
```

1. Main analytic weight in `NWEIGHT` variable
2. Jackknife weights in `NWEIGHT1`-`NWEIGHT60` variables

::: {.notes}
- The RECS data has jackknife replicate weights, so using the second function (`as_survey_rep()`)
- Using the documention for RECS, learn the variable names for the weights, the type, and the scale
:::

## Results

# Calculate means {background-color='{{< brand color secondary >}}'}

## Syntax

The `survey_mean()` calculates means while taking into account the survey design elements.

```r
survey_mean(
  x, # <1>
  na.rm = FALSE, # <2>
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"), # <3>
  level = 0.95, # <4>
  proportion = FALSE,
  prop_method = c("logit", "likelihood", "asin", "beta", "mean"), # <5>
  deff = FALSE, # <6>
  df = NULL # <7>
)
```

## Implementation

Calculate the estimated average cost of electricity (`DOLLAREL`) in the United States:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: calc-mean-nohl
recs_des %>%
  summarize(elec_bill = survey_mean(DOLLAREL, 
                                    vartype = c("se", "ci")))

                                    vartype = c("se", "ci")))
```

- Use the survey design object, not raw data

                                    vartype = c("se", "ci")))
```

::: {.notes}
- Estimated average cost of electricity is in the first column
- Standard error is in the second column
- Confidence interval is in the third and fourth columns (lower bound, upper bound)
- This is the standard R output, we will show later on how to make these into prettier tables
:::

## Calculate means with groups

Calculate the estimated average cost of electricity in the U.S. (`DOLLAREL`) **by each region** (`Region`) by including a `group_by()` function with the variable of interest *before* the `summarize()` function:

```{r}

recs_des %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(elec_bill = survey_mean(DOLLAREL,

## Implementation: one-sample t-test {auto-animate=true}

Stephanie usually sets her home to 68&deg;F at night during the summer. Is this different from the average household in the U.S.?

First, look at the estimated average nighttime temperature U.S. households set their homes to during the summer (`SummerTempNight`).

```{r}
#| label: calc-mean-2
recs_des %>%
  summarize(mu = survey_mean(SummerTempNight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

::: {.notes}
- Note if you don't specify a variance type, the default is to output the standard error
:::

## Implementation: one-sample t-test 

Test if the average U.S. household sets its temperature at a value different from 68&deg;F using `svyttest()`:

``` {r}
#| eval: false
#| label: calc-t-test-nohl
recs_des %>%
  svyttest(
    formula = SummerTempNight - 68 ~ 0, 
    design = ., 
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

## Implementation: one-sample t-test {auto-animate=true}

Test if the average U.S. household sets its temperature at a value different from 68&deg;F using `svyttest()`:

``` {r}
#| eval: false
#| label: calc-t-test-hl-formula
#| code-line-numbers: '3'
recs_des %>%
  svyttest(
    formula = SummerTempNight - 68 ~ 0, 
    design = ., 
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

- Formula to test if the true mean of `SummerTempNight` variable minus 68&deg;F is equal to 0

## Implementation: one-sample t-test {auto-animate=true}

Test if the average U.S. household sets its temperature at a value different from 68&deg;F using `svyttest()`:

``` {r}
#| eval: false
#| label: calc-t-test-hl-des
#| code-line-numbers: '4'
recs_des %>%
  svyttest(
    formula = SummerTempNight - 68 ~ 0, 
    design = ., 
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```
- Formula to test if the true mean of `SummerTempNight` variable minus 68&deg;F is equal to 0
- Dot notation `.` that passes the `recs_des` object into the `design` argument

## Results: one-sample t-test {auto-animate=true}

Test if the average U.S. household sets its temperature at a value different from 68&deg;F using `svyttest()`:

```{r}
#| label: calc-t-test
recs_des %>%
  svyttest(
    formula = SummerTempNight - 68 ~ 0,
    design = .,
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

  group_by(ACUsed) %>%
  summarize(mean = survey_mean(DOLLAREL, na.rm = TRUE))
```

::: {.notes}
- Add in the group_by here to see the means for each group

## Implementation: two-sample t-test

Test if the electricity expenditure is significantly different for homes with and without air-conditioning:


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: ac-bill-test-nohl
recs_des %>%
  svyttest(
    formula = DOLLAREL ~ ACUsed,
    design = ., 
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

## Implementation: two-sample t-test {auto-animate=true}

Test if the electricity expenditure is significantly different for homes with and without air-conditioning:


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: ac-bill-test-hl-form
#| code-line-numbers: '3'
recs_des %>%
  svyttest(
    formula = DOLLAREL ~ ACUsed,
    design = ., 
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

- Formula with electricity expenditure on the left and air-conditioning usage on the right

## Results: two-sample t-test {auto-animate=true}

Test if the electricity expenditure is significantly different for homes with and without air-conditioning:

```{r}
#| label: ac-bill-test
recs_des %>%
  svyttest(
    formula = DOLLAREL ~ ACUsed,
    design = ., 
    na.rm = TRUE
  )

# Create tables {background-color='{{< brand color secondary >}}'}

## Syntax

With the {gt} package, supply the input data table to `gt()` and add options to modify and format your table.

```r
data %>%
  gt() %>%
  ... add options here...
```

## Implementation

Create a table for estimated average household electricity bill by region:

```{r}
#| label: table-default
recs_tab <- recs_des %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(elec_bill = survey_mean(DOLLAREL,
                                    vartype = "ci"))

recs_tab
```

## Implementation {auto-animate=true}

Pipe (`%>%`) your data frame (`recs_tab`) into the `gt()` function:

```{r}
#| label: table-gt-1
recs_tab %>%
  gt()
```

## Implementation {auto-animate=true}

Continue adding to your table, for example, designating `Region` as a "stub":

```{r}
#| label: table-gt-2
recs_tab %>%
  gt(rowname_col = "Region")
```

## Implementation {auto-animate=true}

Add labels to columns:

```{r}
#| label: table-gt-3
recs_tab %>%
  gt(rowname_col = "Region") %>%
  cols_label(
    elec_bill = "Average",
    elec_bill_low = "Lower",
    elec_bill_upp = "Upper"
  )
```

## Implementation {auto-animate=true}

Add a spanner to break up the labels:

```{r}
#| label: table-gt-4
recs_tab %>%
  gt(rowname_col = "Region") %>%
  cols_label(
    elec_bill = "Average",
    elec_bill_low = "Lower",
    elec_bill_upp = "Upper"
  ) %>%
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Cost of electricity in the U.S. by region",
    columns = c(elec_bill, elec_bill_low, elec_bill_upp))
```

## Implementation {auto-animate=true}

Format numbers using the `fmt_*()` functions:

```{r}
#| label: table-gt-5
recs_tab %>%
  gt(rowname_col = "Region") %>%
  cols_label(
    elec_bill = "Average",
    elec_bill_low = "Lower",
    elec_bill_upp = "Upper"
  ) %>%
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Cost of electricity in the U.S. by region",
    columns = c(elec_bill, elec_bill_low, elec_bill_upp)) %>%
  fmt_currency()
```
